        <h1> Bangladesh </h1>
        <p> Bangladesh is a South Asian country bordered by India, Myanmar, and the Bay of Bengal. 
            Its capital city is Dhaka, and Bangla is the national language. 
            The country became independent in 1971 after the Liberation War. 
            It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with over 170 million people. 
            The national flag is green with a red circle, symbolizing peace and sacrifice.
            The Sundarbans, home to the Royal Bengal Tiger, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
            Bangladesh is famous for Cox’s Bazar, the world’s longest sea beach. 
            Its economy is growing rapidly, with garments and textiles as major exports. 
            The culture is rich with music, festivals, and traditional foods. 
            Despite challenges, Bangladesh is moving forward as a land of resilience and hope.</p>
